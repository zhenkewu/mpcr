Description: Estimation of Treatment Effects in Matched-Pair Cluster Randomized
    Trials by Calibrating Covariate Imbalance Between Clusters. We address
    estimation of intervention effects in experimental designs in which (a)
    interventions are assigned at the cluster level; (b) clusters are selected
    to form pairs, matched on observed characteristics; and (c) intervention is
    assigned to one cluster at random within each pair. One goal of policy
    interest is to estimate the average outcome if all clusters in all pairs
    are assigned control versus if all clusters in all pairs are assigned to
    intervention. In such designs, inference that ignores individual level
    covariates can be imprecise because cluster-level assignment can leave
    substantial imbalance in the covariate distribution between experimental
    arms within each pair. However, most existing methods that adjust for
    covariates have estimands that are not of policy interest. We propose a
    methodology that explicitly balances the observed covariates among clusters
    in a pair, and retains the original estimand of interest. We demonstrate
    our approach through the evaluation of the Guided Care program.
